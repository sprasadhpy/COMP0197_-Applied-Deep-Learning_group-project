The dataset for pretraining is downloaded using data_collection.ipynb
This dataset is used for pretraining the self-supervised VQ-VAE, SegNet and UNet models.

# SegNet

# UNet

# VQ-VAE

We have also compared the training results to a supervised LinkNet model.

VQ-VAE is chosen as the final model and experiments are performed on it - two experiments listed in the vqvae folder under pretrain_experiment.py and classimbalanceexperiment.py
