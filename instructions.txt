The dataset for pretraining is downloaded using DataCollection.py
This dataset is used for pretraining the self-supervised VQ-VAE, SegNet and UNet models.

# SegNet


The pytorch models can be downloaded from https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/ucabap7_ucl_ac_uk/Documents/CW2%20Segnet%20Models?csf=1&web=1&e=54IEqO
Required package tqdm and matplotlib
pip install tqdm
conda install matplotlib
To run the file first download the data from DataCollection.py.
pretrain_dataset_path should be the folder containing the downloaded data from  DataCollection.py
Then run the SegNet.py file

# UNet

# VQ-VAE

We have also compared the training results to a supervised LinkNet model.

VQ-VAE is chosen as the final model and experiments are performed on it - two experiments listed in the vqvae folder under pretrain_experiment.py and classimbalanceexperiment.py
